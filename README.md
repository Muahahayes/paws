## Planned Features and Current Milestone Status
* Log-in planned in next release. Currently the navbars respond to if you are logged in or not so the admin and owner pages are inaccessible. **In final release they will be accessible when logged in.**

* MySQL is set up and populated with test data. Currently the web site doesn't query the database and is using a json for testing admin pages. **In final release the web pages will be showing paginated tables of data from the database.**

* All files are now php files. Currently aside from navbars the pages are rendered client-side. **In final release the Owner's table will be rendered server-side.**
