# PAWS TO CARE
---
A school project from my second js class, learning to use php and mySQL to do server-side web pages.

Setting up
* Put all files in the same folder within your Apache htdocs directory.
* Build the MySQL database using the scripts provided in MySQL.txt (Just put those into the MySQL console and run them).
* Replace all of the host, port, socket, username, password, and dbname values in the .php files (I marked them all with big comment lines to distinguish the block of code).
* Make an Owner called admin in the owners table of the MySQL database and give it a password. This will be the admin log-in for the vets to access the admin pages of the site.
